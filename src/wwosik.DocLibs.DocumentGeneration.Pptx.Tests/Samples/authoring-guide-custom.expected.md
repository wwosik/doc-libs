## Writing Markdown for a deck

The deck is generated from Markdown: headings become slides, and the design (colours, fonts,
logo, footer) is applied for you. Write content, not formatting. A slide is read in seconds:
a title that states the point, then a few short lines.

## Structure

| Markdown | Becomes |
| -------- | ------- |
| The first `#` heading | The cover. The text below it, up to the next heading, is the subtitle. |
| Every later `#` heading | A section divider, with the text below it as subtitle. |
| `##` heading | One slide with that title. |
| `###` heading inside a slide | A bold line (in `::: cards`: a card's title). |
| Text before the first heading, `---`, HTML comments | Nothing: they are dropped. |

- **Keep slides short:** at most about six bullets of one line each, or one table, image or
  diagram with a sentence. Nothing is split across slides: too much text runs off the slide.
- **A table, an image or a diagram gets a slide of its own,** titled like its section; text before
  it goes above, text after it below as a caption. A second one in the same section gets a further
  slide with the same title. Slides that use [layouts](#layouts) keep several on one slide.
- Lists nest with indentation; `1.` lists are numbered. `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `~~strike~~`,
  `` `code` `` and links work; a link needs an absolute URL (`https://…`), others stay text. A
  quote (`>`) is italic. A code block is set in a monospace font.
- **Tables:** up to about six columns and eight rows; column widths follow the content, alignment
  follows the `:--`/`--:` markers. A row whose first cell is `==marked==` is highlighted.
- **Images** (PNG, JPEG, GIF) are referenced by the path given to you, keep their size and are
  only scaled down to fit; `![Chart](chart.png "scale=0.5")` halves the size.
- `==text==` marks text like a highlighter pen.

## Layouts

A `##` slide can ask for more than bullets. It then stacks its blocks top to bottom, and several
tables or diagrams share the slide. Use layouts where they help the point; a plain bullet slide
is fine.

| Markdown | On the slide |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `## Title {kicker="Label"}` | A small label above the title: the chapter or topic. |
| `## Title {.dark}` | The slide on a dark background; both: `{.dark kicker="Label"}`. Use it for one key message, not for many slides. |
| `::: cards` … `:::` with one `###` per card | Two to four boxes side by side: parallel points, options, figures. A line that is only `**bold**` right after the `###` is a big figure. |
| `::: cards` around one list of `- **Title** – text` | The same, one card per item. |
| `::: rows` around one list of `- **Term** – text` | Term on the left, explanation on the right, with rules: benefits, definitions. |
| `::: panel` (or `::: panel dark`) … `:::` | A box behind its content, light or dark. |
| `::: statement` … `:::` | Its first paragraph large and bold: the one sentence to remember. |
| `> [!NOTE]` or `> [!TIP]` | A callout with a bar in the main colour. |
| `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]` or `> [!CAUTION]` | A callout with a bar in the highlight colour. |
| A line of only code spans: `` `Orders` `Invoices` `Stock` `` | Tags, as chips. At least two. |
| In a container, `` - `write-once` text `` | The code span as a bold label, the text beside it. |
| A table cell that is one code span: `` `Done` ``, on a layout slide | A status label; front matter `labels.success: Done` colours it. Categories: `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`, `neutral`; labels no key names are neutral. |

## Why rebuild? {kicker="Motivation"}

::: cards
### Configuration is too complicated
**26 tables**

for 12 kinds of rule.

### Large plans are too slow
**3.2 GB**

of memory per plan.

- **Nesting:** a longer fence holds a shorter one, `:::: panel` around `::: cards` … `:::` and
  `::::`.
- **Rules:** attributes `{…}` only on `##` headings; in `::: cards` nothing before the first `###`;
  `::: rows` holds exactly one list; every item of a `cards` or `rows` list starts with
  `**bold**`.
- Layout slides are not split either: three or four cards with one or two lines each fill a slide.

## Front matter

Settings go in a block at the very top, before anything else. One `key: value` per line, no
nesting and no lists. Leave out what the defaults already do: every key is optional.

```markdown
---
title: Network expansion 2027
author: Planning team
---
```

| Key | Values |
| --- | ------ |
| `title` | The document title in the file's properties. Default: the first `#` heading. |
| `author` | The author in the file's properties. |
| `template` | The design: `neutral`. |
| `layouts.title` | The name of the template's layout for the cover. |
| `layouts.content` | The name of the template's layout for text slides. |
| `layouts.titleOnly` | The name of the template's layout for table, image and layout slides. |
| `layouts.sectionHeader` | The name of the template's layout for section dividers. |
| `labels.success`, `labels.info`, `labels.warning`, `labels.danger`, `labels.neutral` | The [status labels](#layouts) in that category, separated by `;`: `labels.success: Done; Delivered`. |

An unknown key, a key given twice or an invalid value is an error that lists the valid keys.

## Characters

Each character is shown in the deck's font, or in a substitute where that font lacks it. Prefer plain characters (`•`, `–`, `→`, typographic quotes) to symbols, and leave out emoji.

## When something is wrong

Generation stops with a message that says what to fix: an unknown container (`::: grid`), heading
attribute (`{.wide}`) or alert (`[!INFO]`), a `cards` or `rows` item without a bold start, an
image that is not among the files, a front matter key that does not exist, or a broken diagram
with its line. Fix the Markdown and generate again.

# Network expansion 2027

Status and next steps

## Where we stand {kicker="Status"}

- 14 of 20 substations upgraded
- Two delays, both in permitting
- Budget on track

## What it brings {kicker="Benefits"}

::: rows
- **More capacity** – 30 % more load at peak times
- **Fewer outages** – faults are isolated automatically
:::

## Next steps {kicker="Plan"}

| Step | When | Status |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Permits for the last sites | Q1 | `Next` |
| Commissioning | Q2 | `Later` |

## One message {.dark}

::: statement
The grid is ready for twice the solar power by 2027.
